# Overview of the Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to create a summary of the ride sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, rural). And at the same time create a summary of the total weekly fares for each city type and illustrate this with a line graph.

# Results

City Type | Total Rides | Total Drivers | Total Fares | Avg Fare per Ride | Avg Fare per Driver 
--------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------
Rural     | 125         | 78            | $4,327.93   | $34.62            | $55.49
Suburban  | 625         | 490           | $19,356.33  | $30.97            | $39.50
Urban     | 1625        | 2,405         | $39,854.38  | $24.53            | $16.57

We can see that the rural area has the most expensive rate and this is because there are very few drivers in those areas and that is why the trip rate tends to go up. This could be benefitial to the drivers but not so much to the company.

### Total Fare by City Type by Week

# Summary
Business Recommendations
  1. Increase drivers in rural areas so the avg fare per ride decreases but at the same time it could increase the total fares because there are more rides.
  2. Focus on rural cities in order to expand business.
  3. Increase the fare per driver so that there is not so much disparity between city types.
